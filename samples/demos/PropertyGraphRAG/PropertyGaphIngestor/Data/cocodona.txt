Welcome!
Now with three race distances; the original Cocodona250, Sedona Canyons 125, and the Elden Crest 38, Cocodona has something for everyone. Come experience the rugged beauty of Arizona!
The Cocodona250 is the most diverse point-to-point 200+ mile footrace in America. The course is challenging, rugged, steeped in history, and stunningly beautiful. Some steps will be effortless, others will feel impossible, but each will carry you on a life altering adventure. So…welcome to the Cocodona!
Please read through this Runner Guide prior to race week to make the best of your race, and do not hesitate to contact us with any questions. We HIGHLY recommend that Pacers and Crew also read this Runner Guide.

Aravaipa Running
Cocodona is organized by Aravaipa Running. Based in Phoenix Arizona, Aravaipa is a runner-driven organization that promotes trail and ultra running and mountain biking events across Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Hampshire. The production of Cocodona would not be possible without the help of the communities the race passes through, the many staff and volunteers who help in varying capacities from medical to aid stations to course marking and much much more. Learn more by visiting aravaiparunning.com.
4.
History
Cocodona links up some of the most diverse terrain that Arizona has to offer and it also runs through the most important historical towns in the State. Event founder Jamil Coury wanted to find a way to run from the outskirts of Phoenix to downtown Flagstaff - from the Sonoran Desert to the ponderosa pine forest of his home State while also incorporating some of Arizona's oldest towns. The goal is to inspire not only those participating in this grand adventure on foot, but also the people who breathe life into these amazing communities the race traverses through.
The name Cocodona is derived from "Coconino", the county and National Forest where the race ends and "Sedona" one of the most iconic towns surrounded by incredible red rocks we'll traverse through.
2021 was the inaugural year for the event and we had 174 starters and 108 finishers (62% finish rate). Original course progressed west out of Sedona and up onto the Coconino Plateau via the Casner Mountain Grade.
2022 gave us the Crooks Fire and a major reroute (85 miles) of the course. The start line was changed to Prescott with a counterclockwise loop around town and an out-n-back to Skull Valley. Another out-n-back was added in the Munds Park area to keep the mileage up to 250. In addition to the route changes from the fire, we changed the course to leave Sedona to the east and climbed onto the Coconino Plateau via the Casner Canyon Trail. We had 220 starters and 151 finishers (69% finish rate).
2023 was the year we found our final home for the Cocodona course. No more major course changes (hopefully). We also added the Sedona Canyons 125 and the Elden Crest 38 race distances to the event. We had 193 starters and 139 finishers (72% finish rate) for Cocodona, 65 starters/52 finishers for Sedona Canyons, and 112/105 for Elden Crest.

Land Acknowledgment
In the spirit of re-education of whose lands we are on, we acknowledge that the course traverses many Indigenous lands, communities, and landscapes. The route crosses the Akimel O’odham (Upper Pima), Hohokam, Yavapai Apache, Ndee/Nnēē (Western Apache), Jumanos, and Hopitutskwa Indigenous, traditional, and ancestral lands. We offer our respect to all ancestor’s past, present, and future. The Indigenous communities across this route are still here, protecting, healing, thriving, and centering their culture and traditions. The landscape the runners, pacers, and crews follow shows an intersectionality of many Indigenous
4
Tribes, Pueblos, and Nations since time immemorial, a place to gather, have ceremony, trade, travel, and live. We offer our care and gratitude to the land, water, and air, to the Indigenous peoples still here today, and to the next generations. We would like to thank Rising Hearts for providing this beautifully crafted land acknowledgement and all of the work they do to make this world a more socially, economically, and environmentally just place.

Rules
Runners (including runner’s pacers, crew, and spectators) who fail to adhere to these rules will be subject to disqualification from the race.
-
Qualification – While there are no actual qualification requirements for entry, Cocodona250 and Sedona Canyons 125 runners are expected to have adequate mountain/ultra/trail experience to be prepared for the course. We recommend entrants have completed a 100-mile race or greater before race day. However, through-hiking, multi-day backpacking, or other relevant experience is also acceptable. Aravaipa Running reserves the right to refuse entry.
-
Age – Minimum age (at race start) to participate in the race is 18 years without prior approval from the RD.
-
Volunteer Requirement – Runners are NOT required to provide trail work in order to run the race.
-
Gates – The are numerous gates throughout the course. Close all gates behind you.
-
Residential Areas – The course passes through some residential areas. Be respectful of local residents during the race; run single file on side-walks, cross in crosswalks, be quiet at night, don’t shine headlamps at houses, don’t slam car doors, be respectful, etc.
-
Jerome & Sedona – The towns of Jerome and Sedona are extremely sensitive permits for us. Runners need to be courteous of vehicles and pedestrians in these towns. Run on sidewalks, not in the vehicle lane. Crew vehicles should proceed directly to aid stations, be quiet, and NEVER park in residential areas. Crew/Pacer vehicles will not be allowed to park along state highways or within state right of way. Park only in designated parking spaces. Unfortunately, these will be automatic disqualifications if not followed.
-
Outside Aid – Runners may not receive any aid outside of designated aid stations. This includes carrying of gear/supplies/food/water by pacers and support from crew outside of designated aid stations.
6
-
Crew Access – Crew may not provide aid to their runner at any point on the course other than designated crew access aid stations. Vehicles must park off of roadways, may not shadow or follow their runner on road sections, and must obey all traffic laws.
-
Pacer Sections – Cocodona250 pacers are allowed starting at the Whiskey Row Aid Station (mile 79ish). Sedona Canyons 125 pacers are allowed starting at the Munds Park Aid Station (mile 66ish). Pacers are not allowed for the Elden Crest 38 race. Pacers are to accompany their runner on foot (no bikes). Multiple pacers may be used, but only one at a time and must swap out at designated pacer access aid stations.
-
Pacer Bibs & Waivers – Pacers must sign a paper waiver which will be available at each pacer-access aid station. Pacers will be provided with a pacer bib which must be worn and visible while out on the course.
-
Crew / Pacer Parking – Vehicles must park off of roadways, may not shadow or follow their runner on road sections, and must obey all traffic laws. We ask crew vehicles be kept to 1 per runner and that they not arrive at aid stations excessively early or stay long after their runner leaves the aid station. Pacers may NOT park at most aid stations (See Pacer Parking). Do not block any public roadways. Crew/Pacer vehicles will not be allowed to park along state highways (numbered highways) or within state right of way. The desert is a fragile ecosystem, please DO NOT walk, drive, park, or camp on vegetation or Cryptobiotic soil.
-
Access to Crown King Aid Station Restrictions – Cocodona250 ONLY – ALL RUNNERS’ CREWS MUST CHECK-IN AT BUMBLE BEE RANCH PRIOR TO MEETING THEIR RUNNER AT CROWN KING AID STATION. Crews will be released to drive to Crown King once their runner reaches a certain point on the course.
-
SPOT Trackers – Each 250 and 125 runner will receive a SPOT for tracking purposes. Runners may not alter, adjust, or turn off the device and must leave the device on their person for the entire race.
-
Bib & bib belt – Each 250 and 125 runner will receive TWO bibs and a bib belt for identification purposes. Runners must display one bib on their pack or outermost layer of clothing at all times during the race. You don’t have to wear BOTH bibs at the same time.
-
Course – Cutting or deviating from the course will result in disqualification. If a runner gets off course, they must retrace back to the last known marker and continue on the course from there. A time penalty may be issued, at the Race Director’s discretion, for inadvertent deviations from the course.
-
Leaving the Course – Runners may only leave the course FROM AID STATIONS in one of two ways:
o
ONE – Runners may leave an Aid Station on their own (IE – walking) in order to access a hotel or crew vehicle for aid or sleep.
o
TWO – Runners may leave an aid station in a vehicle but they must check out of the race with the aid station captain and leave their SPOT tracker and bib (bib+belt are much easier for this scenario). Before returning to the course, the runner must first check back into the race with the aid station captain and retrieve their SPOT tracker and bib. If either of these two steps are missed, it will result in an automatic disqualification for the runner.
-
Dropping from Race – Runners may only drop from the race at Aid Stations and must fill out a drop form. Do not leave the course without informing a staff member.
-
Courtesy/Kindness – Runners must follow direction and be courteous to race officials and volunteers. Aravaipa will not tolerate hateful or discriminatory behavior by any of our runners, or those associated with the race, regardless of the cause.
-
Pets – Pets are not allowed on the course or at aid stations at any time. Certified service animals are allowed but must be clearly identified.
-
Restroom use on Course – It happens. Step 30’ off the trail and dig a 6” (or deeper) hole. Used wet wipes / TP must be packed out in a zip-lock. DO NOT LEAVE TP ON THE TRAILS!
7
-
Fort Tuthill Aid Station Crew Area – Crews may only setup tents / support areas for their runners inside of the Quad area adjacent to the aid station, not anywhere else within Fort Tuthill.
-
Leave No Trace – Littering on course by runners, pacers, or crew will not be tolerated.

Charity Bibs & Scholarship Entry
We are proud to provide a charity bib program and scholarship entry for Cocodona.
Cocodona Charity Bib Program – Aravaipa has partnered with Wander Project to offer a charity bib program for Cocodona (all race distance options). Runners in this program commit to raising a minimum amount for charity ($5000 for the Cocodona250, $3000 for Sedona Canyons, or $1250 for Elden Crest). A portion of these funds go to cover race costs and charity bib administration and the rest goes to the non-profit(s). Runners have the ability to select their own charity as well as benefitting the official non-profit of Cocodona, Wilderness Volunteers. If you are interested in participating in this program, please DO NOT register on UltraSignup. Instead, register on RunSignup. More information on the program can be found on RunSignup.
Cocodona250 Scholarship Entry – SCHOLARSHIPS FOR THE ’24 RACE HAVE BEEN AWARDED & ANNOUNCED. Competing in the Cocodona250 is a life changing event. If everyone could experience it, we feel the world would be a better place. But the barriers are high. Commitment, training time, logistics, crew, pacers, travel, and the determination needed to complete the race make this a big pill to swallow. Not to mention the large registration fee (it isn’t cheap to organize, we might add). Aravaipa extends the opportunity to one runner who might not otherwise be able to afford the race entry for Cocodona250. If you are not able to afford the Cocodona250 registration, will be ready to take on the physical challenge, and need something to do the first week of May, please email the Race Director with info about yourself, your running history, and why you feel you should be selected for the scholarship. Selection will be made and announced on 10/23/23. THREE ADDITIONAL scholarships entries were made available for the 2024 race thanks to donations from the amazing Cocodona community. If you would like to donate to our scholarship entry pool, you can do so HERE.
10.
Transgender & Non-Binary Policy
At Aravaipa Running, we want to create and ensure a space for every athlete, fostering inclusivity within our sport. It is important to us that all runners and participants are accepted and welcome at our events. In that respect, we have established the following Transgender & Non-Binary Policy.
Transgender Athletes – We will accept each entrant’s declared gender at face value. No additional supporting
evidence is required.
Challenges of Results Involving Transgender Athletes – Aravaipa Running will not tolerate hateful or
discriminatory behavior by any of our runners, or those associated with the race, regardless of the cause. Our
commitment to inclusivity extends to fostering a culture of respect and understanding among all participants.
We expect all parties to behave in a manner that is honest, compassionate, and respectful. Discriminatory
behavior or challenges based on gender identity will not be tolerated or entertained.
8
Non-Binary Athletes – Non-binary and gender non-conforming athletes are encouraged to register as their
self-identified gender. UltraSignup now offers a non-binary option for runners upon registration. We pass this
option on to our runners when they register. If you have an existing account, you may need to edit your
account to indicate your gender as non-binary.
Non-Binary Awards – Awards will be provided to the top-three Non-Binary athletes, alongside the Men’s top-
three, Women’s top-three, and DFL awards.
Policy Review and Feedback – We are committed to ensuring this policy remains up-to-date and equitable.
Your feedback is important to us. If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, please do not hesitate to
email the race director.
11.
Withdrawal / Cancellation Policy
Entry fees are non-refundable. A 75% UltraSignup credit of entry fees paid will be available until 60 days prior to event or 50% between 30-60 days. No race credits will be issued within 29 days of the event. Credits will be good for one year from date of issuance and can only be used once. If you withdraw from an event for which credits were used, you will not be reissued those credits. This reissuance policy also includes credits earned and used by volunteering. No cash refunds or transfers to another participant or event will be issued under any circumstance. No rollovers or transfers to next year. Withdrawals can be made directly in UltraSignup and the credits will be automatically credited to your account. Selling or transferring race entries is not permitted.
Individuals who are pregnant are eligible to receive 100% UltraSignup race credit. In this case, credits will be good for two years from date of issuance.
For merchandise or other add-ons (but not including the standard shirt or equivalent goodie), we will provide a 100% future race credit for the cost of the merchandise or other add-on in UltraSignup up until we order the items. These credits can only be used on race entry fees. After we place the order, we cannot provide any refunds or credits. Race shirts may only be picked up in person at packet pickup, we cannot mail out shirts to participants that do not attend the event.
We understand that issues arise at the last minute that can prevent a runner from arriving at the start line. We incur most costs early in the planning process, and this policy represents our ability to reasonably provide something to runners who cannot attend, while keeping our entry fees low and race quality high.
12.
Gear Requirements
As a runner, you are expected to know your body and how to get through situations of extreme heat, cold, navigation, etc. We will be there if things go way wrong during the race but you must be prepared for the elements. Therefore, we’ll check required gear at specific locations on the course. Runners will not be allowed back on the course without the require gear. Pacers are also required to carry the same mandatory gear.
9
Standard Gear that is required along ALL sections of the course
-
Cell Phone – Good idea of label it with tape/name in case you are charging at an aid station
-

Headlamp w/ extra batteries or method of charging

Aid Stations that will be checking required gear
-
Cocodona250 START LINE – 4 Liter capacity check only, no other cold weather gear checked at the Start Line. Runners must leave the Start Line with the CAPACITY to carry 4 liters of water. You don’t need to leave the start line filled up with water. However, all runners must fill up with at least 4 liters of water at the first aid station, Cottonwood Creek Aid Station (mile 8ish). The next 25-mile stretch is the longest section of the course between aid stations and the hottest and hardest section of the course. It will be in the heat of the day, extremely remote, and exposed. Lots of electrolytes and sun gear is extremely recommended. DO NOT underestimate the difficulty of this section. This 25-mile section takes middle of the pack runners 10 hours and back of the pack runners 12 hours to complete. It’s hard. There are two water stations in this section at mile 11.3 and mile 25.6, both of which you can take no more than 1 liter.

Partner Running Store
And speaking of gear…We’ve partnered with the folks at Run Flagstaff / Run Sedona. They are awesome and are helping out with volunteers along the course.
They are also a SUPER convenient resource if you need gear / nutrition DURING the race. Give them a call… they may even DELIVER TO AN AID STATION FOR YOU if you ask nice.
Run Flagstaff – 204-A E Route 66, Flagstaff. https://www.runflagstaff.com. (928)774-2990.
Run Sedona – 150 SR-179 in Sedona. https://www.runsedonashop.com/. (928)862-2145.
Both store’s hours – Mon–Fri 10am–6pm, Sat 10am–5pm, and Sun 11am–4pm.
14.
GPS Enabled Device
Course markings will be sufficient but not overkill and it is always possible that you zone out and miss a turn. It is MANDATORY for every runner (all distances) and pacer to carry a gps enabled device with the course file downloaded. This device can be a handheld GPS unit, watch, or smartphone. The smartphone is the easiest and least expensive option. To use a smartphone, install a mapping App such as Gaia, GuruMapsPro, TrailForks, or AllTrails to your phone. Then download the course GPX file from CalTopo (Cocodona250, Sedona Canyons 125, or Elden Crest 38) and open the file in the mapping App. Be sure that you export the GPX version of the file and not the GeoJSON version which is the default file type for exports. The course will appear, as well as your location (blue dot). Be sure to place your phone in airplane mode to maximize battery life. Electrical plugs will be available at the following Aid Stations; Camp Wamatochick, Whiskey Row, Mingus Mountain, Sedona, Munds Park, and Fort Tuthill.
The course is ever changing as permitting and other conditions develop. We recommend downloading the final course file to your device a few days before the race.
15.
Eco-Responsibility
The earth is the only one we have. As trail runners, we are blessed to see the beauty, complexity, and fragility of the ecosystems we run through. It is essential for all of us to do our part every day to minimize our own first-world gigantic footprints. We can all do a better job. Help us as we take steps toward a more eco-conscience race experience. We will be reducing where we can, recycling, teracycling nutrition wrappers, accepting used shoe donations for Soles-4-Soles, and purchasing carbon offsets for the event operations. Please consider reducing waste wherever you can and offsetting the carbon you produce from the race
11
through a company like Terrapass. And when you are out in the desert, remember it is a fragile ecosystem, so please DO NOT walk, drive, park, or camp on vegetation or Cryptobiotic soil.
16.
Cupless
In an effort to cut down on the waste produced by this event, Cocodona will be a cupless event for cold drinks. What does that mean? There will be no paper cups for cold drink hydration at the aid stations. Runners will be responsible for carrying their own container, cup, flask, or bottle to refill along the way. Please consider a bottle or hydration pack for water and a reusable, easy-to-carry cup for electrolyte refills and soda. We will provide hot cups for coffee, broth, and soup.
17.

Drop Bags
We request that you keep drop bags as minimal in size as possible and no larger than 60 liters (approx. 24”x12”x12”). Bags larger than 60 liters will not be transported to aid stations. Bags should be clearly labeled with bib number and aid station name. Drop bags are for runners only, no pacer drop bags.
There will NOT be rain or sun protection over drop bags. Please weatherproof your bags if this is a concern. Aravaipa is not responsible for any lost or damaged items in drop bags, including the drop bags themselves.

Time Zone
Ok, this maybe more confusing than it should be. Arizona does not observe Daylight Savings Time and is therefore ALWAYS on Mountain STANDARD Time (BUT KEEP READING). In May, for the race, the time in Arizona will be the same time as in California (Pacific Time).
Bottomline, for race week…you will be on Pacific Time. IE – Same time as San Diego, CA.
20.
Start Time & Bib Numbers
Bib numbers will be assigned at a later date. We do not accept requests for bib numbers.
Cocodona250 – Runners need to arrive at the start line between 3:45am – 4:45am on race morning to complete a final check before race start (4-Liter capacity check and SPOT trackers issued). The start will be a mass start at 5:00am on Monday May 6th. The Start Line is located in the dirt parking lot 600’ north of the Rock Springs Café at 35900 S. Warner Rd, Black Canyon City, AZ.

21.
Course
These courses are point-to-point journeys through central Arizona, linking historic towns and trails off the beaten path. The rich history of the towns combined with some of the little traveled mountain ranges makes these races one-of-a-kind tours of Arizona. From the Sonoran Desert Saguaros to the red rock monoliths of Sedona and then on to the Ponderosa Pine forests and big volcanic peaks of Flagstaff, not to mention all the mining towns and history along the way. These courses pack a lot of beauty in with a big challenge. We are beyond stoked to share the beauty of Central Arizona with you through these rugged courses.
Detailed section descriptions and profiles from the course can be found HERE. Note that this includes ALL sections of the full Cocodona250 course. Sedona Canyons 125 should start reading at Jerome and Elden Crest 38 should start reading at Fort Tuthill Aid Station. Note that any course changes within the last few weeks of the race will not be included in the course description.
Here is a link to the courses in CalTopo (Cocodona250, Sedona Canyons 125, and Elden Crest 38). Courses are ever changing as permitting and other conditions develop. We recommend downloading the final course file to your device a few days before the race.
22.
Course Profile
The lowest point on the Cocodona course (1,877’) is within 2-miles of the start and the highest point (9,241’) is 8-miles from the finish. Let’s just say that last little hill is going to hurt. Total gain for the course is 40,154’ and loss is 34,958’, so you have more to gain from doing the race than you have to lose. Yuck yuck yuck!
Detailed section descriptions and profiles from the course can be found HERE. Note that this includes ALL sections of the full Cocodona250 course. Sedona Canyons 125 should start reading at Jerome and Elden Crest 38 should start reading at Fort Tuthill Aid Station.

Course Marking
The course will be adequately marked, not overly marked. Intersections will be well marked but straightaways will only receive a course marking every ½-ish mile. Self-navigation is part of the expectation. Over the course of 250ish-miles, it is likely that a section or two will be under marked, markings could get removed by disgruntled locals, or, and most likely, you will not be paying attention and miss a turn. This is why it is mandatory for runners and pacers to carry a GPS enabled device with the course file downloaded.
If you experience a section of the course that is under-marked or confusing, please send a text and description of the location to the Race Command phone number on your bib. We will get out and fix it.
The course will be marked with:
-
Orange with black polka dot tape w/ reflectors
-
Orange pin flags w/ reflectors
-
Some critical turns will be marked with arrows
-
Some sections in towns (pavement) will be marked with road sticker
-
Wrong Way – Blue & white checkerboard tape

24.
Roads
The Cocodona250 course has about 119-miles of dirt roads and 26-miles of pavement. The Sedona Canyons 125 course has about 38-miles of dirt roads and 15-miles of pavement. The Elden Crest 38 course has about 5-miles of dirt roads and 4-miles of pavement. Roads will include Forest, County, local, municipal, and state-owned highways, which are subject to all applicable traffic laws. Therefore, you will be running around vehicular traffic and ATVs at some point during the race. Vehicles have the right of way and will NOT stop for you. It is your responsibility to:
-
Obey all traffic laws
-
Don’t run in the vehicle lane. Use sidewalks, bike lanes, shoulders when possible.
-
Run on the left side, facing traffic unless the course marking specifically directs you to run with traffic
-
Look both ways and cross when safe
-
Cross in crosswalks, wait for crossing signals, obey pedestrian laws, and stay safe.
The towns of Jerome and Sedona are extremely sensitive permits for us. Runners need to be courteous of vehicles and pedestrians in these towns. Run on sidewalks, not in the vehicle lane. Crew vehicles should proceed directly to aid stations, be quiet, and NEVER park in residential areas. Parking will not be allowed along state (numbered) highways or within state highway right-of-way. Only parking in designated parking spaces. Unfortunately, these will be automatic disqualifications if not followed.
25.
Cutoff Times and DNFs
You’ve all worked hard to make it to Cocodona and we don’t want to cut anyone from the course. However, it is a long race and there are so many moving parts. We need to ensure runner safety and be able to predict logistics and volunteer shifts. So…cutoff times will be enforced.
Cutoff times are the times you need to LEAVE the aid station, not arrive. If a dropped runner doesn’t have crew, we will shuttle you to the Start Line or the Finish Line as soon as we are able.
Cocodona250 – Overall cutoff for the race is 125-hours.
Sedona Canyons 125 – Overall cutoff for the race is 75-hours.*
Elden Crest 38 – Overall cutoff for the race is 27-hours.*
* Note that these cutoff times are based around the 250-miler and are not indicative of the difficulty of the race or that it will take any runner this long to complete the course.
DNFs happen, especially on a race of this distance. Runners may only drop from the race at Aid Stations with crew access and must fill out a drop form. Do not leave the course without informing a staff member.
See the Aid Station Table at the end of this Runner Packet for full cutoff times.

26.
Volunteers
A race of this magnitude takes hundreds of volunteers to pull off. We are looking for a few (actually more than a few) volunteers to help on race week in many different aspects of the race, including:
-
Staff Roles – There are lots of behind-the-scenes staff roles, including: course markers, aid station setup/teardown crews, shuttle drivers, and many more. These positions are not listed on the general volunteer signup page, so email the Race Director if interested.
-
Aid Station Captains & Assistant Captains – Responsible for obtaining and coordinating aid station volunteers, final setup of the aid station, providing a safe, efficient, fun, and clean aid station experience for all runners, and breakdown after the race cutoff. Email the Race Director to discuss qualification.
-
Aid Station Volunteers – Show up on race day and assist runners with their food, hydration, and gear needs. Help identify race drop bags for runners and provide that all important encouragement.
-
Course Sweep – We need 2 runners per section of trail to run behind the last runner and clear the trail of course markings and any litter.
-
Setup and Teardown – Help set up and tear down the Start Lines and Finish Lines.
Volunteers will receive Aravaipa race credits ($14/hr for Aid Station Captains, $12/hr for Assistant Captains, and $10/hr for volunteers) that can be used for registration costs at future Aravaipa races. Volunteers will also receive either a volunteer shirt or additional Aravaipa race credits. Extra credits will also go to volunteers who take more than one shift per race. Finally, you will be part of one of the most exciting new races in the US!
Volunteer signup COMING SOON.
27.
Aid Stations
Our goal is to provide top notch aid stations at Cocodona. In addition to all the normal staples, most aid stations will have a hot “meal” option. See below for a preliminary menu listed by aid station. Aid station food may be slightly different from location to location on race week based upon race day logistics and last-minute changes but consider this a pretty solid plan of what you can expect for food on race week.
Vegetarian and vegan options may not be listed in the menu below but they WILL be available at every aid stations. Gluten free can be made to order at most aid stations. We are not a restaurant or a grocery store but if you have special dietary needs please contact our Aid Station Guru Pati directly ASAP, so that we can prepare in advance.
ALL aid station will have TRADITIONAL OFFERINGS similar to the following:
PB&J sandwiches, bean roll-ups, Snyder’s Pretzels, Lay’s Potato Chips, trail mix, Welch’s Gummies, Oreo Cookies, Chips Ahoy Cookies, pickles, cooked potatoes, bananas, clementine oranges, and when possible… watermelon. There will not be ANY Gels/GUs/Blocks/Waffles/etc. Only real food, so bring your own.
Drinks: Water, ice, Coke, Ginger Ale, Mountain Dew, and Gnarly Fuel2O.
HOT offerings: Hot water for instant coffee, hot chocolate, tea, Ramen, broth, and oatmeal.
18
In addition to Traditional Offerings, aid stations will have a menu similar to the one below from the 2023 race:
The Elden Crest 38 race will also include water stations at miles 9.4 and 22.5.
Fortunately, the terrain allows the Aid Stations to be spaced well. The average distance between aid is 12 miles. The longest distance between aid on the Cocodona250 course is 25 miles (so sorry about that one). The rest are spaced really well.
Pacers are welcome to all the food and drinks they would like from aid stations while they are CURRENTLY pacing. Crew and inactive pacers may not partake of food/drink from aid stations. Please drop your used nutrition wrappers at the aid station Teracycling container so they can be upcycled by Teracycle.
Electrical plugs will be available at the following Aid Stations; Camp Wamatochick, Whiskey Row, Mingus Mountain, Sedona, Munds Park, and Fort Tuthill.
28.
Restrooms
There will be portable toilets at every aid station. Please do your best to time your bowels. If you can’t, we get it, it happens. Carry toilet paper with you. Step 30’ off the trail and dig a 6” (or deeper) hole. All toilet paper
19
and wet wipes must be packed out in a zip-lock and thrown away in the trash. DO NOT leave toilet paper on the course! And when you are out in the desert, remember it is a fragile ecosystem, so please DO NOT walk on vegetation or Cryptobiotic soil.
29.
Sleep
You might be able to pull it off without sleep…but probably not. Feel free to take a trail nap or sleep in an aid station chair at any time. We will also have 7 aid stations designated for sleep stations. Sleep stations are for runners only, no pacers. See below for a description of these locations:
-
Kamp Kippa Aid Station – Indoor bunks (Heated space) – NO CREW ACCESS. NO DROP BAGS
-
Camp Wamatochick Aid Station – Indoor bunk rooms (Heated space) – NO CREW ACCESS. YES DROP BAGS
-
Whiskey Row Aid Station – Indoor cots (Heated space)
-
Mingus Mountain Camp Aid Station – Indoor bunks (Heated space)
-
Dead Horse Ranch State Park Aid Station – Outdoor individual tents w/ cots (NOT heated)
-
Sedona-Posse Grounds Park Aid Station – Indoor cots (Heated space)
-
Munds Park Aid Station – Indoor cots (Heated space)
-
Fort Tuthill Aid Station – Indoor cots (Heated space)
Note that we will supply the cot or bunk but not the sheets, blankets, pillows, or snuggies.
Most of the Aid Stations with sleep stations (listed above) are accessible by crew/pacers and also have drop bags. We recommend placing sheets or a sleeping bag liner in your drop bag where you plan to sleep at an INDOOR location. We recommend placing a sleeping bag in your drop bag where you plan to sleep at an OUTDOOR location.
Many runners will choose to sleep in crew vehicles / vans / RVs. See the Aid Station Vehicle Access & Crew Parking section in this Runner Guide for aid stations with adequate parking for larger vehicles. Remember the rule that runners may only leave the course FROM AID STATIONS, see the Rules section for the two options on how this can be done.
For runners who prefer to go plush, there are hotels very close to aid stations in many locations; Whiskey Row Aid Station, Iron King Aid Station, Jerome Historic State Park Aid Station, Dead Horse Ranch State Park Aid Station, Sedona-Posse Grounds Park Aid Station, Munds Park Aid Station, and Fort Tuthill Aid Station. Remember the rule that runners may only leave the course FROM AID STATIONS, see the Rules section for the two options on how this can be done. See Hotels section for info.
30.
Crew
Is it necessary to have a Crew? No, but a good crew can sometimes mean the difference between a buckle and a DNF. And life is more fun when you share it with friends and family.
Crew may not provide aid to their runner at any point on the course other than designated crew access aid stations.
20
Crew vehicles must park off of roadways, may not shadow or follow their runner on sections of road, and must obey all traffic laws. We ask crew vehicles be kept to 1 vehicle per runner and that they not arrive at aid stations excessively early or stay long after their runner leaves the aid station. Crews are no permitted to stop or park along state (numbered) highways or within state highway right-of-way.
The towns of Jerome and Sedona are extremely sensitive permits for us. Crew vehicles should proceed directly to aid stations, be quiet, and NEVER park in residential areas. Crews are no permitted to stop or park along state (numbered) highways or within state highway right-of-way. Only parking in designated parking spaces. Unfortunately, these will be automatic disqualifications if not followed.
Dogs are not allowed on the course or at aid stations at any time, especially Mingus Mountain Camp Aid Station. Certified service animals are allowed but must be clearly identified.
We ask that Crew members not eat or drink from aid stations.
Crew are only allowed at certain aid stations. See the Aid Station Table at the end of this Runner Guide for a list of the aid stations where crew is allowed. Runners will be disqualified if their crew shows up at a non-crew-access aid station.
Trash & Recycle – Crews are asked to please drop trash and recycling at the Sedona Aid Station and/or the Fort Tuthill Aid Station. Please don’t drop trash/recycling at any other aid station.
Access to Crown King Aid Station Restrictions – COCODONA250 ONLY – ALL RUNNERS’ CREWS MUST CHECK-IN AT BUMBLE BEE RANCH PRIOR TO MEETING THEIR RUNNER AT CROWN KING. Crews will be released to drive to Crown King once their runner reaches a certain point on the course. See the Crown King Restrictions Section for more info.
Elden Crest 38 – Crews are not allowed on the course or at any aid station.
31.
Pacers
Is it necessary to have pacers? No, not at all. Many 200+mile runners do so without pacers but we aren’t sure if it is because they are ultra-tough or just don’t have any friends.
21
Cocodona250 Pacer Access Aid Stations:
Sedona Canyons 125 Pacer Access Aid Stations:
22
Elden Crest 38 – Pacers are not allowed.
Pacers are to accompany their runner on foot (no bikes). Multiple pacers may be used, but only one at a time and must swap out at designated pacer access aid stations. For Cocodona250, theoretically you could have 12 different pacers, one for each pace-able section of the course.
Pacers may not provide any assistance to their runner other than encouragement. No pushing, pulling, carrying, ect or mule-ing (carrying of gear/supplies/food/water).
Pacers must be human (no pets), 18-years of age or older, sign a waiver at the aid station where they start pacing, wear a pacer bib provided at the aid station where they start pacing, and carry the same required gear as runners. If a parent or legal guardian desires to have a minor (under 18) pacer, please contact the Race Director.
Sleep stations are for runners only, no pacers. Pacers are welcome to all the food and drinks they would like from aid stations while they are CURRENTLY pacing but not before/after they are done pacing.
Pacers may NOT park at most aid stations (See Pacer Parking).
32.
SPOT Tracker
For the Cocodona250 and Sedona Canyons 125 races, real-time GPS tracking (SPOT Trackers) will be provided by TrackLeaders. Your family, friends, and crew will be able to see your real-time position along the course during the race, as well as some other interesting details such as current pace, moving time, stopped time, avg moving speed, etc. You (the runner) will NOT need cell service for this device to work, it will work everywhere on the course. However, anyone wanting to see your position WILL need data (cell service) to see the tracking webpage. This applies to crew wanting to see their runner’s position during the race. Fortunately, there is very good cell service throughout the course.
The SPOT Trackers will be issued at the Start Line just before the mass start of the race. They are lightweight and small, about the size of a pager (remember those?). They are stored inside of a Velcro sleeve that can be easily attached to your person, ideally the shoulder strap of a hydration pack. Runners may not alter, adjust, or turn off the device and must leave the device on their person for the entire race.
Elden Crest 38 race does not include SPOT tracking.
LINK FOR RACE LIVE TRACKING will be provided at a later date
33.
Medical
Our medical provider, MedStar Solutions, will have medics at various aid stations along the course. These medic’s primary responsibility is emergency care for runners. Foot care is the runner’s responsibility. Medics
23
will do their best to help runners with foot care issues when they are not handling more urgent medical care issues. See the Aid Station Table at the end of this Runner Packet for exact medic locations.
Any runner who receives an IV during the event will be automatically disqualified.
If you need medical attention out on the trail (not at an aid station) during the race or if you see another runner out on the trail who needs medical attention, please send a TEXT to our emergency contact below. Please program this number into your phone before race day.
EMERGENCY CONTACT DURING THE RACE
Send a TEXT to # TO BE PROVIDED AT A LATER DATE

Training, Coaching, and Camps
The distance is long. The course is steep and rugged. It will be hot and cold. That pretty much sums it up.
Official Cocodona Training Run presented by Kahtoola to take place on April 6th, 2024 – The first 37 miles of the course is arguably the hardest of the entire race. Come join us for a training run on this section on April 6th. Thank you, Kahtoola, for providing each Training Run runner with a pair of gaiters and for donating $50/Training Run runner to Wilderness Volunteers (the race non-profit partner). Registration for this training run and additional details can be found HERE.
Official Training and Coaching Partner – Coming soon.
Heat Training – The race is in the desert and it will get hot during the day. Arizona typically has very low humidity, so your sweat will evaporate quickly. Remember to drink even if you don’t feel like you are sweating. There are sections with absolutely no shade or tree cover. Heat, dehydration, and hyponatremia can take a huge toll on runners who are unprepared. Train in the heat if you can. If you can’t, set up a plan to keep cool. Experiment with sun hats, long sleeve shirts, sun sleeves, and sun gloves. In addition, make sure you have your pack dialed in to carry the required gear, including enough salts and fluid capacity.
Terrain – Some sections of the course are butter smooth single-track. Other sections are barely paths at all but more resemble rocky riverbeds or eroded ravines. It is beautiful and it is rugged. Prepare for this by training on rocky terrain wherever you can. You will also be running through several sandy washes. We would suggest training in sand to see how your pace and feet hold up. Kahtoola gaiters are highly recommended.
Slow It Down – Keep it at an easy pace, especially early in the race. Walk the uphills. The more Long Slow Distance training you can do the better. And yes, long hiking days are great training.
Multi-Day – The 200+ mile distance is all about multi-day. We recommend a few trainings blocks of 2-4 days with 25-40 miles/day.

Things to do in Flagstaff
Flagstaff is not only the finish line for the Cocodona races, it is also a very cool town. From breweries, restaurants, coffee shops, a cool Observatory, to endless miles of single-track, Flagstaff has it all. Checkout the city’s website for a guide to all things such as restaurants, breweries, hotels, and much much more.
41.
Weather
The desert is known for dramatic daytime to nighttime temperature swings and the midday sun can be intense. Expect some parts of the course to be very hot during the day, others to be very cold at night, and yes, there could be snow.
Two parts of the Cocodona250 course specifically could be quite hot during midday; the Sonoran Desert (mile 0-30) and the Verde and Sedona Valleys (mile 130-180), each seeing average daytime highs in the mid-80s°F. Not coincidentally, these two sections are the lowest elevation points on the course and don’t have much shade. Note that the Verde and Sedona Valleys are mile 5-55 of the Sedona Canyons 125 race.
Conversely, the highest elevation points on the Cocodona250 course will probably be quite cold at night. The Bradshaw Mountains (mile 30-75), Mingus Mountain (mile 111), the Coconino Plateau (mile 172-248), and Mount Elden (mile 242) see average nighttime lows between 40-25°F. Note that the Coconino Plateau and

Mount Elden are miles 47-125 and mile 116 respectively for the Sedona Canyons 125 race. Elden Crest 38 runners will not miss out on the freezing cold temps as they go up and over Mount Elden as well.
