<message role="user">Please extract up to {{$maxTripletsPerChunk}} knowledge triplets from the provied text.
Each triplet should be in the form of (head, relation, tail) with their respective types.
######################
ONTOLOGY:
Entity Types: {{$entityTypes}}
Relation Types: {{$relationTypes}}
    
Use these entity types and relation types as a starting point, introduce new types if necessary based on the context.
    
GUIDELINES:
- Output in JSON format: [{""head"": """", ""head_type"": """", ""relation"": """", ""tail"": """", ""tail_type"": """"}]
- Use the full form for entities (ie., 'Artificial Intelligence' instead of 'AI')
- Keep entities and relation names concise (3-5 words max)
- Break down complex phrases into multiple triplets
- Ensure the knowledge graph is coherent and easily understandable
