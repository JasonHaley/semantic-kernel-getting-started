# Getting Started with Semantic Kernel

This repository contains the source code for serveral blog posts and presentations I have given in 2024. Most are available in the [semantic-kernel listing on my blog](https://jasonhaley.com/tags/semantic-kernel/)

## Blog Entries
I have a couple of blog series that include Semantic Kernel. 

### Semantic Kernel Hello World (Blog Series)
This series is about individual features of Semantic Kernel. The source code is supposed to be reusable source code for future projects.

#### [Semantic Kernel Hello World](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/03/30/semantic-kernel-hello-world/)
(*March 30, 2024*) This is a very simple walk through of using Semantic Kernel to call an OpenAI chat completion endpoint.

#### [Semantic Kernel Hello World Plugins Part 1](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/04/11/semantic-kernel-hello-world-plugin-part1/)
(*April 11, 2024*) This walks through creating prompts in text files and using them with Semantic Kernel.

#### [Semantic Kernel Hello World Plugins Part 2](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/04/26/semantic-kernel-hello-world-plugin-part2/)
(*April 26, 2024*) This is about Native Functions in Semantic Kernel and converts the previous prompt into a native function.

#### [Semantic Kernel Hello World Plugins Part 3](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/04/30/semantic-kernel-hello-world-plugin-part3/)
(*April 30, 2024*) This builds on the native function entry and extends it to use Open AI function calling.

#### [Semantic Kernel Hello World Planners Part 1](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/05/19/semantic-kernel-hello-world-planners-part1/)
(*May 19, 2024*)  This moves the same sample to using the Handlebars planner and analyzes what it does.

#### [Semantic Kernel Hello World Planners Part 2](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/05/27/semantic-kernel-hello-world-planners-part2/)
(*May 27, 2024*) This takes the same approach as the previous blog entry but uses the Function Calling Stepwise Planner.

#### [Semantic Kernel Hello World WebSearchEnginePlugin](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/06/10/semantic-kernel-hello-world-websearchengineplugin/)
(*June 10, 2024*) This takes a look at the usefulness of incorporating the ability to have the LLM call Bing search.

### Study Notes (Blog Series)
This series is where I am putting resource created from specific topics like text-to-sql and graph RAG.

#### [Study Notes: Text-to-SQL](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/07/05/study-notes-text-to-sql/)
(*July 5, 2024*) This is the post describing what I learned focusing on Text-to-Sql for a week.

#### [Study Notes: Text-to-SQL Code Sample](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/07/06/study-notes-text-to-sql-code-sample/)
(*July 6, 2024*) This is the post about code that I put together to demonstrate how Text-to-Sql works.

#### [Study Notes: Graph RAG - Property Graph RAG](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/08/05/study-notes-graph-rag1/)
(*August 5, 2024*) This is the post describing what I learned focusing on graph RAG (specifically property graph RAG).

#### [Study Notes: Graph RAG - Property Graph RAG (The Notebook)](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/08/06/study-notes-graph-rag1-code-sample-notebook/)
(*August 6, 2024*) This is about the C# notebook I put together to highlight the steps and demonstrate property graph RAG.

#### [Study Notes: Graph RAG - Property Graph RAG (The Projects)](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/08/16/study-notes-graph-rag1-code-sample-projects/)
(*August 16, 2024*) This is about the C# projects I created for the ingestion and retrieval functionality of a property graph RAG system.

## Presentations

#### [Boston Azure June 2024](https://jasonhaley.com/2024/06/25/boston-azure-june-2024/)
(*June 25, 2024*) This highlights the demo code I used in the in person (no recording) Boston Azure meeting in June.
